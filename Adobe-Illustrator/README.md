# Adobe Illustrator 

Tips, tricks, and how-tos of map making in Adobe Illustrator with Map Publisher extension 

## Fonts

- Apply halo to text:
	- Create object (draw a square or something similar)
	- Apply a fill of your choosing (this will be your text color)
	- Apply a Stroke (white or perhaps your main background color)
	- Bring that stroke under the fill in the appearance window 
	- Apply a transparency (75% or something is usually nice and not too overwhelming)
	- Optionally, adjust stroke Cap/ Corner (Corner 'round join' looks great!)
	- Drag your object into the Graphic Styles window and give it a name 
	- If you want to update the style (you've made changes) hold option/alt key and drag over graphic style to update
